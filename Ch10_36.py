# (Tkinter: linear search animation) Write a program that animates the linear
# search algorithm. Create a list that consists of 20 distinct numbers from 1 to
# 20 in a random order. The elements are displayed in a histogram, as shown in
# Figure 10.17. You need to enter a search key in the text field. Clicking the
# Step button causes the program to perform one comparison in the algorithm
# and repaints the histogram with a bar indicating the search position. When
# the algorithm is finished, display a dialog box to inform the user. Clicking the
# Reset button creates a new random list for a new start.
